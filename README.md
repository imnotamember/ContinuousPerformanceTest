# ContinuousPerformanceTest
A psychopy-based remake of the clinical diagnostic test (VIGIL).

## To run this experiment
1. Download a copy of PsychoPy2 here (This project is only tested with Python 2.7.x)
### Mac:
https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/download/1.90.1/StandalonePsychoPy2-1.90.1b-MacOS.dmg
### Windows:
https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/download/1.90.1/StandalonePsychoPy2-1.90.1-win32.exe
### Linux:
```shell
sudo apt-get install psychopy=1.90.1
```
2. Install Psychopy and launch it into "Coder". Don't know what that is? Check here: http://www.psychopy.org/gettingStarted.html
3. When you've gotten a "Coder" window, goto `File->Preferences` and then select the "Coder" tab. On this tab, check "read-only" and click "OK" to save/close.
4. Download this repository to your computer by clicking the green "Clone or download" button above and select "Download ZIP". This compressed file can be unzipped anywhere (preferably in your Documents folder for cleanliness-sake).
5. Open the freshly unzipped file "Continuous Performance Test.py" using `File->Open...` in the "Coder" menu (or click the folder icon).
6. Now that you have the script open, click the green run button, save if asked, and begin answering the window prompts.
7. When you run the program, it will ask you how many rounds (blocks) of K trials you want to run. Then it will ask the same for the AK trials.
Here’s a quick rundown of you’re typical options:
0 = Skip this task
1 = ~2 minutes
2 = ~4 minutes
3 = ~6 minutes
4 = ~8 minutes
8. Fill in demographic information and Press okay to start!



Good luck!
